Introduction to HashiCorp Vault

Secret data is everywhere, from database credentials, TLS certificates,
API tokens, to encryption keys. Managing secrets is a difficult challenge,
but HashiCorp Vault provides an answer. In this talk, we discuss the
challenges in secret management, provide an overview of Vault, and
discuss how Vault is operationalized and used in the real world.
