Neovim: edit text on your own term(s)!

Neovim is a divisive topic among software developers. Negative opinions cite
horrific defaults, a confusing user interface, a dearth of out-of-the box
features, lack of discoverability, and a weird genesis that split an existing
community. In this talk, we address these critiques and make a case for using
terminal-based Neovim as your primary Linux-based software development
environment. We cover Neovim's history (Vi -> Vim -> Neovim), how to use it as
a modern IDE, and how it aims to be more than just a text editor. Join us as we
discuss a controversial Vim fork with a big dream: to be the Kernel of modern
text editing!
